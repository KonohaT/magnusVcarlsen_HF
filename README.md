Prompting the models takes about 30sec per move, so leave it running for the analytics.

magnusVcarlsen pits LLMs against in a chess game! This will let us collect data on illegal move frequency, processing speed and matchup results. The LLMs include general-purpose models like GPT2 and models fine-tuned on chess games. Currently, we can have two models compete and collect/display statistics. And we hope to expand this into a chess tournament with Stockfish API analysis of each move.
